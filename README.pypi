PyResistorColorCode is a Python module that provides some tools to
manage IEC 60062 marking codes for resistors.

The associated program resistor-decoder provides a graphical user
interface to help user to decode a resistor colour-coding using an
inference algorithm. This feature is an enhancement compared to a
program like gresistor which is only a colour-coding calculator.
